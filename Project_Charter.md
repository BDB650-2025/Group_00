# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 1. Introduction

Credit card fraud is a critical challenge for financial institutions, causing significant financial losses and reputational damage. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based fraud detection system that can identify and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time. By leveraging advanced data analytics and anomaly detection techniques, the system will help reduce financial losses, improve customer trust, and enhance the bank's security measures.

## 2. Overview

Build a machine learning model using historical transaction data to detect fraudulent credit card activities and integrate the model into a real-time fraud detection system.

### 2.1 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an automated, real-time fraud detection system using machine learning models to minimize fraudulent transactions. The system will be trained on a comprehensive dataset of credit card transactions, utilizing both supervised learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression and decision trees) and anomaly detection techniques (e.g., isolation forests and one-class SVM). The model will be optimized for accuracy and efficiency through preprocessing techniques, including data normalization, handling class imbalances, and feature engineering. The project will also implement a real-time processing pipeline using Spark to evaluate transactions instantly and flag suspicious activities. This initiative will reduce financial losses, enhance customer confidence, and support the bankâ€™s security operations.
